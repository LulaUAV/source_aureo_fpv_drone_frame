# About SOURCE AUREO
## The idea

The SOURCE AUREO is an ultralight 7" frame, made for pilots who crave for range. Made with a rohacell like material sandwiched between 2 layers of carbon, the result is a super lightweight 7" frame - @49.5g. It fits and protects all the up-to-date components and is optimized for range. The SOURCE AUREO is your perfect long range cruiser, and is recommended for pro pilots only.

The SOURCE AUREO project is a collaborative FPV frame project initiated by Team BlackSheep. The frame is donated to the community to empower creators and makers, and integrate best practices and current trends faster into a continuously manufactured product. In return, it allows the local distribution network to have cheap and direct access to a good frame in order to allow them compete in an increasingly predatory marketplace.

The hope is for this frame to enable broad access to FPV thanks to a low price point, great documentation and wide availability of compatible parts and accessories, without violating other people’s intellectual property.

## Project naming requirements
SOURCE AUREO is the name of the frame. If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “TBS SOURCE AUREO”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have placed as basis of the project, e.g. “TBS SOURCE AUREO V0.1”. 
If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between SOURCE AUREO and your project.
Accessories from the SOURCE AUREO project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “TBS SOURCE AUREO FPV Camera Adapter”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “TBS SOURCE AUREO FPV Camera Adapter V0.1 - V2”
